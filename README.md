# Multi Layer Perceptron

## Classification with MLPs
- In this, I have used two datasets, `WineQT.csv` and `HousingData.csv`.
- We can use MLPs for both classification and regression tasks
- In `MLP_classification.ipynb` I have used them for classification, both single label and multi label.
- For single label classification, the last layer has a softmax activation function, and for multi label classification, the last layer has a sigmoid activation function.

## Regression with MLPs
- For this, i have used the `HousingData.csv` dataset.
- In `MLP_regression.ipynb` I have used MLPs for regression.
- The last layer has a linear activation function.
